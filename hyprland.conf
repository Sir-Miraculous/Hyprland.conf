## Note 
# Follow Mouse Cursor

    0 - Cursor movement will not change focus.
    1 - Cursor movement will always change focus to the window under the cursor.
    2 - Cursor focus will be detached from keyboard focus. Clicking on a window will move keyboard focus to that window.
    3 - Cursor focus will be completely separate from keyboard focus. Clicking on a window will not change keyboard focus.
